[[sdfootnote5]]

[[sdfootnote5sym]] Open does not necessarily imply free of cost. Depending on a SDO's business model, costs of developing standards are recovered from membership fees or sales.

[[sdfootnote6]]

[[sdfootnote6sym]] Specifications may be industry or community developed. Industry-driven specifications typically start as closed or proprietary based on their intellectual property value and a company's investment in research and development. Some owners of closed specifications make open libraries available for others to read and right, providing a level of openness. As specifications mature, some are released through open licenses to the community as open specifications. Some International and Community standards begin as industry developed open specifications and de facto standards.

[[sdfootnote7]]

[[sdfootnote7sym]] A Community standard is an official position of the OGC endorsing a specification or standard developed external to the OGC and is considered a normative standard by OGC membership and part of the OGC Standards Baseline. Examples of open specifications that have achieved OGC Community Standard status include the _OGC 3D Tiles Specification_ and _OGC Indexed 3d Scene Layer (I3S) and Scene Layer Package Format Specification_. https://www.ogc.org/standards/community[https://www.ogc.org/standards/community]

[[sdfootnote8]]

[[sdfootnote8sym]] Examples of endorsed Good Practices include the Defence Geospatial Information Working Group (DGIWG) Comm/TIFF Profile for Imagery & Gridded Data 2.3.1 (OGC Best Practices https://www.ogc.org/docs/bp ) and INSPIRE Good Practice: SDMX for Human Health and Population Distribution (INSPIRE Good Practices https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/portfolio/good-practice-library )

[[sdfootnote9]]

[[sdfootnote9sym]] De facto standards can be endorsed as international standards over time, for example, _HTML, PDF_, and _GeoJSON_ have followed this route https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/de-facto-standard[https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/de-facto-standard] and https://www.ogc.org/blog/2543[https://www.ogc.org/blog/2543]
